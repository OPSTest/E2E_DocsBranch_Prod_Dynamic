> Multiple team dashboards and the widget catalog are available from TFS 2015.1 or later versions. For TFS 2015 and earlier versions, you don't have access to multiple team dashboards. Instead, your home page serves as a single team dashboard. For information on SharePoint dashboards, see Project portal dashboards.
